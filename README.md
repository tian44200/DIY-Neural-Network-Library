# DIY-Neural-Network-Library
Modular neural network implementation from scratch in Python and NumPy. This project implements core components of deep learning, including linear layers, activation functions, loss functions, backpropagation, and convolutional layers. Developed as part of the M1 Machine Learning course project at Sorbonne University in collaboration with @carinemoubarak. The project is primarily in French and has not been fully polished yet.
